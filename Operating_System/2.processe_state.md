# Program

- A program is that which resides on our harddisk
  - Like c++ program in .cpp

# Process

- A process is nothing but a program in execution

# Single Tasking System(MS DOS)

```

- In Single Tasking System, only one program can be executed at a time
- When a program is finished, it is terminated and removed from memory
- Then the next program is loaded into memory and executed
- If Process is doing so I/O operation, then CPU is idle and waiting for I/O operation to complete and this is very inefficient and wastage of CPU time

# Multi Programming System

- Where multiple processes runs at the same time and CPU is never idle

# Multi Tasking System

- Where multiple processes runs at the same time and CPU is never idle and a time slice is given to each process
- A fixed Quantum of time is given to each process and after that time, the process is preempted and another process is given a chance to execute

# Process Control Block(PCB)

- PCB is a data structure maintained by os for every process
- PCB used for storing the collection about the processes
- PCB identified by an integer process ID(PID)
- PCB lies in Kernel Memory space
- PCB deleted once the process id completed

# Short Term Scheduler and Dispatcher

- Short term scheduler is only responsible for selecting the process from the ready queue and then Dispatcher came in to action
- Dispatcher is responsible for allocating the CPU to the selected process
- Dispatcher is also known as context switcher
- Dispatcher is responsible for saving the context of the current process and loading the context of the selected process

# When Short term Scheduler came into action

- A). when some other processes moves from running to waiting.
- B). When some other processes moves from running to ready
- C). When new/existing process moves to ready(priority is higher)
- D). When a process terminates
- Premptive Scheduling in B and C case only
- Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling in which a process can be preempted from CPU and another process can be allocated to CPU

B--Waiting<br>Time-->C
C--Burst<br>Time-->D

```

- ⭐Arrival Time: Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
- ⭐Completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution.
- ⭐Burst Time: Time required by a process for CPU execution.
- ⭐Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.
  Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time
- ⭐Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.
  Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time
- ⭐Arrival Time=1  ⭐Completion Time=6 ⭐Turn Around Time = 6-1=5 ⭐Burst Time=3 ⭐Waiting Time = 5-3=2

# Goals of CPU Scheduling

- ⭐Max CPU Utilization
- ⭐Max Throughput
- ⭐Min Turn Around Time
- ⭐Min Waiting Time
- ⭐Min Response Time
- ⭐Fair CPU Allocation(No starvation)

- Avg Waiting time =5.2 and it is lesser
- implemented through mean heap algorithm
- it is greedy algorithm
- TC : O (nlogn)

# SRTF(Shortest Remaining Time First ) Algorithm

- Method with Preemption
- Criteria :Burst
- Mode: Premption
- Premption: Means cpu will execute the process to a fixed quantumn time it will not care for process completion

- Starving of Low Priority in Priority Scheduling
  - Solution: Aging

# Round Robin Scheduling

- Uses time Quantum
- Circular Queue(ready queue)
- Average waiting time can be higher but response time is good
- Sensitive to quantumn
  - smaller quantum time: context switch overhaed
  - large quantum : become FCFS

- Processes from one queue to another queue will not change
- This will cause startvation
- A process can have a longer wait time and cause starvation

# MultiLevel Feedback Queue Scheduling Algorithm(MLFQ)

![1704618090165](image/2.processe_state/1704618090165.png)

- No starvation problem
- Windows and Mac OS uses MLFQ
- Linux uses MLQ but now it uses more advanced algorithm
