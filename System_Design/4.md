# Normalisation

- Putting data in multiple table to reduce redundancy

# Denormalisation

- Putting data in one table to increase performance

## Benefits of Denormalisation

- Faster reads
- Simpler queries
- Management Convenience
- High availability
- Reduces the network calls
- Reduces the number of joins

## Drawbacks of Denormalisation

- Slower writes
- Redundant data- wastage of space and money
- Increase Complexity
- Data inconsistency
- Difficult to maintain

# Indexing

- Indexing is a way to optimize the performance of a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed. It is a data structure technique which is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database.

```

## Where Asynchronous Communication is necessary

- Computation takes a lot of time
- Scalability of application
- Avoid Cascading Failures

# Message Based Communication

- Client send requests in the form of messages to the server and server send response in the form of messages to the client
- so it is asynchronous communication

## Producer

## Consumer

## Agent

## P2P Model

- Peer to Peer Model
- Email are not sent immediately
- Email are stored in the queue and then sent
- Email are sent in the form of messages
- Email are sent asynchronously

## Public Subscriber Model

- Email are sent to all the subscribers
- Email are sent in the form of messages
- Email are sent asynchronously

## Examples

- Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- ActiveMQ
- Amazon SQS

# Kafka

- Zomato :

  - Live loaction of delivery partner we see
  - life feed we are getting each second of driver location
  - this can not be done using data base because if we are calling database each second our database will go down
  - throughput of database is low
  - throughput of kafka is high
- Kafka has high throughput
- but Kafka's storage is temporary and very low
- DB: throughput low ,storage high, we can query the data

## Sharding

- Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts. These smaller parts are called data shards. The word shard means "a small part of a whole."

## Partitioning

- Partitioning is a database design technique that splits large tables into smaller ones. There are several benefits to partitioning data in a large database. Partitioning can make large tables more manageable and scalable, and it can speed up query times when dealing with large tables.

## Difference between Sharding and Partitioning

- We do sharding when we have to scale our database horizontally
- We do partitioning when we have to scale our database vertically
- Sharding is done when we have to scale our database to multiple machines
- Partitioning is done when we have to scale our database to single machine

**We will be doing partitioning in case of Kafka to manage large data because Kafka is singly here and here we can vertically scale the system so Partitioning will be here**
