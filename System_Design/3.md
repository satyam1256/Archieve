# Caching
## What is caching?
- Caching is the process of storing data in a cache.
- A cache is a temporary storage area.
- Caching is used to speed up data access.
- Caching is used to reduce load on underlying resources.
## Real world example
- I have used caching in my project to reduce the load on the database.
- website link :[FMC Weekend](https://www.fmcweekend.in/)
- I have used caching in the following way:
  - I have used caching to store the data of the users who have registered for the event.
- Their Profile data is stored in the cache.
- When the user logs in, the data is fetched from the cache.
- If the data is not present in the cache, then the data is fetched from the database and stored in the cache.
- This reduces the load on the database.
## Types of caching
- There are two types of caching:
  - **In Memory/Local Cache**
  - **Distributed Cache/Internal Cache**
### In Memory/Local Cache
- In Memory/Local Cache is a cache that is stored in the memory of the server.
- Example:
  - Memcached
### Distributed Cache/Internal Cache
- Distributed Cache/Internal Cache is a cache that is stored in a shared network/memory.
- Example:
  - Redis
## When to use caching?
- Caching should be used when:
  - The data is not updated frequently.
  - The data is not sensitive.
  - The data is not large.
  - static content (images, videos,html,css etc.)
  - Example :
    - Read Intensive in Twitter
    - Read Intensive in Facebook
    - Read Intensive in Instagram
## Types of caching we are storing in our project
- Application Server Cache 
- CDN
## Cache Eviction
- Cache eviction is the process of removing an entry from the cache on a definite time or on a condition.
## Cache Eviction Techniques
- How we are deleting the data from the cache?
- There are following types of cache eviction techniques:
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used) Eviction**
  - **LFU (Least Frequently Used) Eviction**
  - **FIFO (First In First Out) Eviction**
  - **MRU(Most Recently Used) Eviction**
  - **LFU (Least Frequently Used) Eviction**
  - **LIFO (Last In First Out) Eviction**
  - **RR (Random Replacement) Eviction**
### LRU (Least Recently Used) Eviction
- In this technique, the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
### LFU (Least Frequently Used) Eviction

- In this technique, the entry which is least frequently used is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least frequently used is removed from the cache.
### FIFO (First In First Out) Eviction
- In this technique, the entry which is first inserted in the cache is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is first inserted in the cache is removed from the cache.
### MRU(Most Recently Used) Eviction
- In this technique, the entry which is most recently used is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is most recently used is removed from the cache.
### LFU (Least Frequently Used) Eviction
- In this technique, the entry which is least frequently used is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least frequently used is removed from the cache.
### LIFO (Last In First Out) Eviction
- In this technique, the entry which is last inserted in the cache is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is last inserted in the cache is removed from the cache.
### RR (Random Replacement) Eviction
- In this technique, the entry which is randomly selected is removed from the cache.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is randomly selected is removed from the cache.
## Cache Invalidation
- Cache Invalidation is the process of removing an entry from the cache on a definite time or on a condition.
## Cache Invalidation Techniques
- How we are deleting the data from the cache?
- There are following types of cache invalidation techniques:
  - **Time To Live (TTL)**
  - **Write Through**
  - **Write Back**
### Time To Live (TTL)
- In this technique, the entry is removed from the cache after a definite time.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
### Write Through
- In this technique, the entry is removed from the cache after a definite time.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
### Write Back
- In this technique, the entry is removed from the cache after a definite time.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
## Cache Consistency
- Cache Consistency is the process of maintaining the consistency of the data in the cache.
## Cache Consistency Techniques
- How we are maintaining the consistency of the data in the cache?
- There are following types of cache consistency techniques:
  - **Write Through**
  - **Write Back**
### Write Through   
- In this technique, the entry is removed from the cache after a definite time.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
### Write Back
- In this technique, the entry is removed from the cache after a definite time.
- Example:
  - If the cache size is 5 and the cache is full.
  - If we want to add a new entry in the cache, then the entry which is least recently used is removed from the cache.
# File Based Storage System
## What is File Based Storage System?
- File Based Storage System is a system in which the data is stored in the form of files.
- Example:
  - File System
## When to use File Based Storage System?
- File Based Storage System should be used when:
  - The data is not updated frequently.
  - The data is not sensitive.
  - The data is not large.
  - Example :
    - Read Intensive in Twitter
    - Read Intensive in Facebook
    - Read Intensive in Instagram
## Types of File Based Storage System
- There are two types of File Based Storage System:
  - **Local File System**
  - **Distributed File System**
### Local File System
- Local File System is a file system that is stored in the memory of the server.
- Example:
  - Ext4
### Distributed File System
- Distributed File System is a file system that is stored in a shared network/memory.
- Example:
  - HDFS
## Challenges in File Based Storage System
- Data Redundancy
- Data Consistency
- Data Security
- Slow Data Access

# Database
## RDBMS
- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- RDBMS is a database management system that is based on the relational model.
- Stored data in the form of tables.
- Connected data with the help of foreign keys.
- Example:
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
### Advantages of RDBMS
- Data Redundancy is reduced.
- Data Consistency is maintained.
- Data Security is maintained.
- Data Access is fast.
- Data Integrity is maintained.
### Disadvantages of RDBMS
- Rigid Schema
- Scaling is difficult(Horizontal Scaling)
- High Cost
- Not suitable for unstructured data
- Vertical Scaling is possible but it is expensive and limited.
## NoSQL
- NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL.
- NoSQL is a database management system that is not based on the relational model.
### Types of NoSQL
- There are four types of NoSQL:
  - **Key Value Store**
    - Generrally used for caching.
    - Example:
      - Redis
      - Memcached
  - **Document Store**
    - Brimgs both RDMS and NoSQL together.
    - Used for storing unstructured data.
    - Example:
      - MongoDB
      - CouchDB
  - **Column Store**
    - Used for storing large amount of data.
    - For Data Management during machine learning.
    - Column Store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in columns rather than rows.
    - Example:
      - Cassandra
      - HBase
  - **Graph Database**
    - Example:
      - Neo4j
      - OrientDB
