# Web Server

- Tools or programs that help keep the web application always up and running
- Just like a computer, a web server has a CPU, memory, and storage
- The web server is responsible for storing and serving the web application’s static assets, content, images, videos, and other files
- On hardware side web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website’s component files
- On software side web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers’ HTTP clients
- Web server is a computer that runs websites

## Difference between Web Server and Application Server

- Web server is a computer that runs websites
- Application server is a program that handles all application operations between users and an organization’s backend business applications or databases
- A web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers’ HTTP clients

# Communication Protocols

- A protocol which set a rule between client and server to communicate with each other
- can be implemented in hardware or software or combination of both

## Models

### Pull/Polling

- Client send request to server and wait for response

### Long Polling

- Client send request to server and wait for response
- Number of requests too much
- Server will store the request in the queue
- Server will send response to the client after some time
- Server will awake the client after some time
- Server will always busy

### Push

- In this model server will send response to the client without any request
- The server pushes new events to the client as they happen
- Reduces the server load
- Example: Facebook, Twitter likes

### Socket

- Socket is a two way communication protocol
- Client and server can send and receive data at the same time
- Example: Chatting application

### Server Sent Events

- Server Sent Events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a client to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection
- Example: Stock market,Cricket score

# Difference between Website and Web Application

- Website is static
- Web Application is dynamic

## Client and Server

- Client is a computer that request data from the server
  - Example: Browser,Instagram App
- Server is a computer that stores data and send data to the client
  - Example: Instagram Server

## Requirement for communication between client and server

- Fast
- Light Weight
- Language Independent
- Platform Independent
- Enable Communication over the n/w

# REST

- REST stands for Representational State Transfer
- REST is an architectural style for developing applications that can be accessed over the network
- CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

# SOA(Service Oriented Architecture)

- SOA is a style of architecture that promotes loose coupling and granular application to make the components of the software reusable

## Advantages

- Selective scalability
- Different Tech Stacks
- Loose Coupling
- Agile(Independency)

## Disadvantages

- High Latency
- High Complexity
- Complex uderstanding
- complex to secure

# Microservices

- evolution of SOA
- Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are
  - Highly maintainable and testable
  - Loosely coupled
  - Independently deployable
  - Organized around business capabilities
  - Owned by a small team
- different databases

# Tier Architecture

- Tier is a logical partition of the application
- Frontend, Backend, Database different tiers
- First tier is the client tier, second tier is the application tier, and the third tier is the database tier
- Each tier is completely independent from the other tiers, except for the interface to the next tier
- Each tier can be managed or scaled independently

# Authentication vs Authorization

- Authentication is the process of verifying who you are
- Authorization is the process of verifying what you have access to

# Basic Authentication
- Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol
- Each time username and password is sent to the server
- It is not secure
- It is not used in production
## Token Based Authentication
- Token based authentication is stateless
- Token is generated by the server and sent to the client
- Token is stored in the client side
- Token is sent to the server for every request
- Token is valid for a certain period of time
- Token is not stored in the server side
- Token is stored in the client side
## OAuth
- OAuth is an open standard for access delegation
- OAuth provides client applications a 'secure delegated access' to server resources on behalf of a resource owner
- Can be login with google,facebook,github etc
